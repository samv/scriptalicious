README for Scriptalicious
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is a simple little module that contains a few of the things that
I just wished Perl came with for writing SysAdmin scripts.

Using this module, it is very easy to write programs which more or
less adhere to the GNU program conventions for well behaved programs.
Things like printing the name of your program before all messages.

It is suggested that you try the example in the manual page, and see
how it responds to `-v', '-h', unknown switches, etc.

Required Modules
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Module::Build is required to build and install the module.
Test::Simple is required to run the test suite.

Other than this, there should be no `hard' dependancies, other than
modules that come with 5.6.1.  However, scripts that use this module
don't show help messages without Pod::Constants.

Recommended Modules
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If you want the scripts that use this module to display their help
messages, you need to install Pod::Constants, which requires
Pod::Parser (which should be standard with recent Perls).

If you don't, you can still use `perldoc foo.pl' on the installed
scripts, so it's still better than nothing.

Optional Modules
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If you want your help screens to look nice with all terminal sizes,
you will need Term::ReadKey.

If you want accurate timing information about how long programs take
to execute when you use `-v', you will need Time::HiRes installed.

Installation instructions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Once you have satisfied yourself that you have installed Module::Build and and the recommended and 
enough to satisfy your hunger for modules, you should To install this
module.

  perl Build.PL
  ./Build test
  ./Build install

If you're running Debian, you might like to use:

  dpkg-buildpackage -b -uc -rfakeroot
  dpkg -i ../libscriptalicious-perl_1.0_all.deb
