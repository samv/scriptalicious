=back

=head2 VERSION 1.10

Add prompt_file from an earlier branch.

Fix F<Build.PL> so a compatibility Makefile.PL is generated.

=head2 VERSION 1.09

Another "brown paper bag release".  Fixed a bug in tsay that would
cause it not to work if there was a true value in $1 already.  Bring
on Perl 6 and lexical $/.

=head2 VERSION 1.08

Added new functions 'anydump' and the awesome 'tsay'

=head2 VERSION 1.07

Brown paper bag release - the prompting had some debug statements
left behind.

=head2 VERSION 1.06

Documentation modifications only; it was quite rightly pointed out
that the documentation didn't really say what the script is useful
for.


=head2 VERSION 1.05

=over

=item B<Prompting>

Prompt the user for arbitrary things via prompt_for(-int => "foo"),
with readline support.

=item B<Filehandle Plugging and Playing>

All functions that run things (ie C<run()>, C<run_err()>, C<capture()>
and C<capture_err()> can now have arbitrary filehandle connections to
closures (via a sub-process), named files or filehandles.

=back

=head2 VERSION 1.04

Bug fix for scripts that fork (see F<t/04-fork.t>)

=head2 VERSION 1.03

=over

=item B<YAML config file support>

Do your C<getopt()> and C<YAML::Load()> in one pass!  See C<getconf()>
in the man page.

You can even include the default YAML configuration file in your POD
via Pod::Constants!  Soon to be documented and tested by the test
suite :).  But the daring can go put some YAML in a section called
"C<DEFAULT CONFIGURATION FILE>"

=item B<Quick and dirty timer functions>

New timer utility functions C<start_timer()>, C<show_delta()>,
C<show_elapsed()>

=item bugfix

C<barf()> now does not make your script exit if inside C<eval {}>; it
checks C<$^S> and re-throws the error instead.
